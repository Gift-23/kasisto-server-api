## Overview

Dynamic Guided Conversations are simple conversation that can be added to KAI. The main difference with traditional intents is that KAI delegates the execution of the conversation to a Server component called *Guided Conversation Webhook*. During the conversation, this Webhook takes over to orchestrate the interactions with the user. It uses KAI as a NLU processing engine and to process other requests such as FAQs or other intents available in KAI.

## Nominal flow

The following sequence diagram illustrate a sample Dynamic Guided Conversation.

1. The user tells KAI "I want to renew my credit card ending with 1234"

2. KAI understands that the user wants to trigger a Dynamic Guided Conversation.
Using its knowledge, KAI identifies the form to trigger as "Renew Card" and the card number specified by the user.
KAI invokes the Server's Guided Conversation Webhook to start a new conversation.

3. The Server's Webhook initiates the form input and processes the provided data.
The card number is valid for this user and the form detects that it also needs the expiration date of the card.
The Webhook builds a question for the user "Sure, What is the expiration date of your card?" and asks KAI to capture another parameter that is a date.

4. KAI pushes the message to the User.

5. The user answers the question with "It's Feb 10 2018".

6. KAI detects that the input contains a date as expected and sends the date to the Server's Webhook.

7. The Server's Webhook validates that the date is correct. If the date is incorrect, the Webhook asks for the date again and builds a new message for the user: "The date you entered is invalid. What is the expiration date of your card?"

8. KAI push the message to the User.

9. The user answers the question with "My bad it's Feb 11 2018"

10. KAI detects that the input contains a date as expected and sends the date to the Server's Webhook.
 
11. The Server's Webhook verifies the date and this time it is valid. At this stage, all the required data is captured. The Webhook process the request and informs KAI that the form input is complete with a message to the user.

12. KAI displays the completion message to the User and the flow is complete.

## Conversation Triggers 
For Guided Conversations, the triggers are defined in KAI. For each conversation, KAI is trained to understand different types of Sentences. 
The Sentence can be a simple trigger or it can contain additional *slots*.
- "*I want to renew my card*" is a simple trigger to a conversation to renew a card.
- "*I need to renew my card* **ending with 1234**" is the same trigger with an additional contextual slot, the requested *card last 4 digits*
- "*renew my card expiring* **today**" is another trigger with the requested *expiration date* 

For this sample conversation, KAI would be trained with the following form:
- **form name** : Renew Card
- **form sample sentences** :
    + "I want to renew my card",
    + "I need to renew my card *{@card_number 5532}*",
    + "renew my card expiring *{@expiration_date on Tuesday}*",
    + "renew card expiring *{@expiration_date next month}*",
    + "can I renew my card?",
    + "renew my card *{@card_number 3321}* expiring *{@expiration_date tomorrow}*",
- **form optional slots** :
    + **field 1** :
        * **name** : card_number
        * **type** : number
    + **field 2** :
        * **Name** : expiration_date
        * **Type** : date

## Interruptions
A user may, in the middle of a guided form, ask the system an *out-of-form* question instead of answering the last form question he was presented with. For example, a form may ask the user how much money he is willing to put down on the mortgage he is applying for. At that point the user may decide to find out how much money he has in his accounts and ask the system "What are my balances?". 

For each form, KAI can allow access to certain *Intents*. KAI can allow the user to check his account information. The mechanism can also be used to enable *FAQ* (all FAQs) or *Definition* (all banking glossaries)  during a form, thus enabling users to learn more about the form or other products while they are in the process of completing the form. 

When KAI interprets a question as out of form, it provides an answer to that question, and then asks again the last form question, which it had already asked, before the user entered the out-of-form question, and which the user has not responded to yet. 

#### Notes
1) For this mechanism to work property, the allowed-out-form Intents should not ask follow up questions. They should rather be completed after KAI provides its initial answer.

2) The default mechanism for out-of-form questions is to re-ask the last form question after the out-of-form intent responds. Thus multi-turn intents should not be enabled (e.g. paying a person or transfering money) within a form. 

## Multi-language support
It should be noted that KAI requests sent to the Webhook include a *locale* parameter. This parameter can be used by the Webhook to distinguish different locales before generating a response.

## Integration with the Server
When KAI identifies a trigger and capture the *slot* details (all slots are optional), KAI initiates the Dynamic Guided Conversation with the Server's *Guided Conversation Webhook*.

The Webhook should implement the following services:
- **start conversation** : service used by KAI to initiate a new conversation between the User and the Webhook.
- **send user input** : service used by KAI to send the User input to the Webhook when a value is received.

More details on the services is available in the [Webhook API Overview](api-overview.md).
